Dear colleagues,

Dynamic fuel cycle simulation codes are promising tools for assessing nuclear
fuel cycle future options. Several institutions or laboratories around the
world develop their own tools, based on many different philosophies, with
different objectives and implementation choices. Linking these research
efforts (NEA/IAEA expert groups and projects, European project Opticycle
proposed by CIEMAT, DOE Fuel Cycle Options, national collaborations, etc…) is
valuable to support and develop collaborations around nuclear scenarios.

Following last year's `successful workshop
<https://lpsc-indico.in2p3.fr/Indico/event/1357/>`_ organized by the
CNRS/IN2P3, **the University of South Carolina is organizing a `second
technical workshop <http://twofcs.ergs.sc.edu>`_ in Columbia, SC, dedicated to
fuel cycle calculations and scenarios on July 19-21, 2017**. The workshop
organization will be supported the University of South Carolina and the Cyclus
development community include the rental of conference venue and coffee
breaks.

The goals of this meeting would be the following:
- Present and evaluate the works done in different institutions with varied
  perspectives
- Contribute to building a community around nuclear scenario topics in order
  to be able to answer efficiently calls for project at national and
  international levels.

The topics of interest include:
-    Fuel cycle simulation tools and physics models
-    Transition scenarios studies
-    Optimization algorithms
-    Uncertainties analysis
-    Interdisciplinary studies (economics and sociology)
-    Fuel cycle simulation results visualization

Participants willing to present an oral contribution should `submit an
abstract <https://goo.gl/forms/wCWJT7P7biPbccP83>`_ (maximum 400 word) by April
3, 2017.

For technical questions about the workshop, please contact Anthony Scopatz: scopatz@gmail.com.
For logistics questions about the workshop, please contact Victoria White: VBWHITE@mailbox.sc.edu 

Thanks in advance for forwarding this call to any people that could be interested in this workshop.

Looking forward to seeing you in Columbia, SC.

Anthony Scopatz and Robert Flanagan, for the TWoFCS2 organizing committee
